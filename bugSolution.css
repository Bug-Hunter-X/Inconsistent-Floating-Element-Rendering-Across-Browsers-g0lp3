The following corrected CSS code utilizes flexbox to achieve consistent layout across different browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensure padding and border are included in element width */
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

By using flexbox, we ensure the elements wrap onto the next line when necessary, ensuring consistent layout across various browsers without relying on the potentially inconsistent behavior of floating elements.
